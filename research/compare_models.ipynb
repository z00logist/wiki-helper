    "Choosing the best model for service is not an easy task. We need to pay attention to multiple parameters. In particular, for my case, I will be looking at three dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Quality**\n",
    "* **Time per Iteration**\n",
    "* **Model's size**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to the last two parameters (time per iteration and model size), they are relatively straightforward to measure. However, evaluating the quality parameter requires a more specific methodology.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How I will measure quality:\n",
    "\n",
    "Since my downstream task involves **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for Wikipedia articles, it makes sense to use the classical **SQuAD Dataset**. My approach will be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The system will answer questions based on the provided Wikipedia article.\n",
    "2. I will then compute the **BERTScore** between the predicted answer and the ground truth answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that the answers in SQuAD are quite specific, using BERTScore will allow me to assess whether my system captures the correct semantics, even if there is some variation in the exact wording.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Models for Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "I have selected three models for evaluation, all of which are \"mini\" models. While some have more parameters than others, they share a common quantization method: **GGUF**. This method ensures consistency across the models in how they reduce precision while maintaining model accuracy. Here's a bit more detail on the models and the quantization process:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Quantization Method: GGUF (Q6_K Format)\n",
    "In this case, all models have been quantized using the **Q6_K** method, which provides a balance between performance and memory efficiency.\n",
