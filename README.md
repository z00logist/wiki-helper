### Step 3: Asking Questions

Once you've opened a Wikipedia article, you can begin interacting with the bot. Here's how it works:

When you ask your first question, the bot will automatically read and process the article in the background. Simply input your query, and the bot will use the content of the article to answer.

#### 2. Bot Answers Your Question

After processing the article, the bot will respond with answers based on the article's content. You can ask follow-up questions, and the bot will continue to reference the same article for context.
